#April Fools Ride (AFR)

Once a year, a mountain bike event takes place where this app is used to communicate spontaneous events during the ride (dangers, accidents, etc).

The initial version of this app was Rails and Twilio.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
