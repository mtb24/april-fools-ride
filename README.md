#April Fools Ride (AFR)

:bike:
Once a year, a mountain bike event takes place where an app is used to communicate spontaneous events among the participants (dangers, info, etc).

The initial version of this app was slapped together with [Rails and Twilio](https://github.com/mtb24/AFRmessages).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
